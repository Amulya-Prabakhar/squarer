Description : 
Academic Project of Digital design and Synthesis course. In this Project, we have implemented an arithmetic unit which performs A2 – 1 operation, which takes 8-bit signed input and results in 16-bit output. The design methodology used is by converting signed number to unsigned one and feeding it to multiplier to carry out squaring. We have proposed two different methodologies for the squarer unit. Later, pass the result through adder to perform minus one operation.
We have used the structural design for constructing VHDL code and Test Bench. ModelSim is the tool used for compilation, simulation and for RTL. Also we have used XILINX ISE to find area and timing report through which we can determine the performance of the unit.
